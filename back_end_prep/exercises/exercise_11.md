Online API sources I read:
1. api.rubyonrails.org
2. ruby-doc.org
3. apidock.com

Usually I just google it, then pick the first result. And recently I use Dash more, so I read the first two more often by its default.
But sometimes when I want more example showing how to use the method, I'll google it then read it on apidock.com.
